  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - 'asset/images/man.png'
    - 'asset/images/woman.png'
    - 'asset/images/levelsport.jpg'
    #localization
    - 'lang/en.json'
    - 'lang/ru.json'
    # - 'lang/ua.json'
    # - 'asset/translations/ru-RU.json'
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: OpenSans
      fonts:
        - asset: asset/fonts/OpenSans-Light.ttf

    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: asset/fonts/Poppins-Medium.ttf
            
    - family: DBIcon
      fonts:
        - asset: asset/icon/fonts/MenuDB.ttf
